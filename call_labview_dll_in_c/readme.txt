This example is designed to illustrate the concept of sharing LabVIEW code by building a DLL.  Included in this example are C and CVI applications that Acquire, Analyze, and Present data by calling LabVIEW-built DLL's.  In order to facilitate in running the C code, projects have already been built in Microsoft Visual C++ and in LabWindows/CVI.  To run the run C code, simply open up one of the project folders and execute.  Also included in this example is the source code behind the LabVIEW-built DLL's and the buildscript used to create the DLL's.  This example was written in conjunction with the document "Can LabVIEW C?", which compares C and LabVIEW's funcitonality.  Specifically, this example demonstrates that a developer can take advantage of LabVIEW's strenghts even if he or she is forced to program from another environment.

Requirements:
LabVIEW 7.0 or LabVIEW 7.0 Evaluation Software is required to view and run the LabVIEW source code behind the DLL's.

Microsoft Visual C++ or LabWindows/CVI is required view and execute the C code.  Feel free to download the LabWindows/CVI 7.0 Evaluation Software to run the C code and to try the premium C environment for measurement and automation applications.

The LabWindows/CVI Run Time Engine is required to run the CVI executable.
